        <h3>Dear Green Bean,</h3>
        <p> First and foremost, I hope you are doing wonderfully this Easter day! Its a beautiful day and I wish that I could spend it all with you. Given the fact
            that you've got quite a bit to do school-wise though, I guess I'll have to forgo a bit of Cait time for a little bit. That said, it gives me plenty of
            time to think about different ways to surprise you, and plenty of date ideas for us to go on once this whole pandemic has gone away :)
        </p>
        <p> My lack of thinking ahead has landed me in a little pickle though as far as the Easter treats have gone, so hope you're okay with me dropping by tomorrow
            to bring a couple more treats that I've had in mind. Perhaps some Easter noods for you to enjoy while finishing your papers or to munch on during those
            incredibly long lectures? In any case, I want to help out as much as I can since the smile you get and the joy you have when you get them stellar grades
            brightens up my day immensly. I love to see you succeed in all that you do!
        </p>
        <p> Well, heres the wrapping up point for this little test message. I think I'll stick with paper for the most part, but there are some pretty cool things I
            can do using web development to make these messages extra special ;P So I'll definitely keep them as a part of my letters to you.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0"> I love you so very much,</p>

        <p>P.S. -> This Easter I wanted to try something a little different. Ill never stop making paper notes for you - don't worry ;P - but I've had this idea for a while
             and thought that it would be pretty cool. </p>

        <p>P.P.S -> Ill take this off the open internet if you would like after you've read it, but I'll keep the files so that we can have access to them locally one day when
            we have our own place, mwah</p>
