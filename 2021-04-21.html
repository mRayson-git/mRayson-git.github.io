        <p>Dear sweetheart,</p>
        <p>
            It's finally happened, the stress of exams is over! On top of that you get to see me pretty darn soon as well!
            Now I know that this term did not go exactly as you planned, but I want you to know that I'm so proud of you and feel so 
            lucky to be your boyfriend. Nothing goes exactly as we plan but you trucked on through and now you're just one step away 
            from getting that degree ;P.
        </p>
        <p>
            If only Douggy was not so adamant on keeping us apart, this would be the perfect time for us to get some quality time together.
            I'm almost done work - in fact by the time you read this message I'll have completed my final sprint review meeting and won't have
            to deal with those gosh darn presentations anymore - and you are free from school, we've got so much free time and yet we're still 
            gonna be trapped in our homes :/. It's proper sad boi hours.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enough sad boi talk though! Even though Douggy may try, you'll be coming by to scoop me up and away we
            shall go on an adventure to the ol guelph. We'll get a good couple of days together before the proper lockdown happens and I'm looking
            forward to every second of it :). While this pandemic sure has been shitty, I'm kinda glad you were able to come back here and do school
            online since we really have been able to see so much more of each other than we otherwise would have. Always gotta look on the bright side ;P
        </p>
        <p class="fw-light">Enjoy your flowers & goodluck on your exams!</p>
